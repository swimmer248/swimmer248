## Hey there! I'm Thomas Lowe!

I am a web developer who loves computers (especially the software side) and coding. I code as a hobby, and hopefully I'll do the same as a job. I can learn new languages rather quickly, and am good at designing a website. I am at my best when I'm in a group, with each person doing their part.

Skills: JS / HTML / CSS

Iâ€™m currently working on a game called Immortal Chef and learning front-end web development.

My pronouns are he/him/his.
