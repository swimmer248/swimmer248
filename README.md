### Hello! ğŸ‘‹

My name is Thomas Lowe. I am currently a student at the Cape Central Career and Technology Center at the time of writing, and have an interest in independent game development. Both of these are because of my great interest in computers, especially the software side. I know a decent amount about web development, and can get a handle on new languages extremely quickly.
