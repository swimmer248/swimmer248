![Future indie game dev and web developer](https://arturssmirnovs.github.io/github-profile-readme-generator/images/banner.png)

I am a web developer who loves computers (especially the software side) and coding. I code as a hobby, and hopefully I'll do the same as a job. I can learn new languages rather quickly, and am good at designing a website. I am at my best when I'm in a group, with each person doing their own part.

Skills: JS / HTML / CSS
